# 1. Experiment Design
In current study, we used a **picture-word stroop** for perceptual experiment  
to investigate the behavioral performances and brain activations  
in _stutters_ and _non-stutters_ using a lexical-semantic task with different levels of attention allocations.  
The experiment consisted of two two-factor by two-level designs:   
(1) 2 (_condition: prime_ / _non-prime_) * 2 (_group: stuttering_ / _control_),  
i.e., **low-level attention allocation condition**   
(2) 2 (_condition: inhibition_ / _non-inhibition_ ) * 2 (_group: stuttering_ / _control_),  
i.e., **high-level attention allocation condition**  
# 2. Behaviour data analysis
