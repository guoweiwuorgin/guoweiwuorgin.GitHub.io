# 1. Experiment Design
In current study, we used a picture-word stroop for perceptual experiment  
to investigate the behavioral performances and brain activations  
in stutters and non-stutters using a lexical-semantic task with different levels of attention allocations.  
The experiment consisted of two two-factor by two-level designs:   
(1) 2 (condition: prime/ non-prime) * 2 (group: stuttering/ control),  
i.e., low-level attention allocation condition;   
(2) 2 (condition: inhibition/ non-inhibition) * 2 (group: stuttering/ control),  
i.e., high-level attention allocation condition.  
# 2. Behaviour data analysis
